			<p>Born in 1967 in Mexico City, Ortega is the leading Mexican artist of the generation that emerged in the wake of the influence of Gabriel Orozco and Francis Alÿs. Ortega studied with Orozco in the informal studio class established in the older artist’s atelier in the late 1980s. There, he absorbed the acute attention to form associated with Orozco’s sculpture and photography, subsequently refining his own visual and conceptual vocabulary that emerged through his focus on the points of intersection between architecture, sculpture, and spatial analysis.

Ortega’s work can be found in myriad of public and private art collections both in the United States and abroad, and has been seen in numerous exhibitions worldwide. He currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany, and Mexico City.
